**Overview of the Project**

**Project: Password Generator**

**Objective**
The objective of this code is to generate a secure, random password of a user-specified length, ensuring it contains at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one digit, and one special character.

**Key Activities**
Input Prompt: The user is asked to enter the desired password length.

Validation: The length is checked to ensure it is at least 4 characters for security.

Character Selection:
One lowercase, one uppercase letter, one digit, and one special character are selected to ensure variety.
Additional random characters (letters, digits, and symbols) are added to meet the required length.
Randomization: The password characters are shuffled to ensure randomness.

Output: The generated password is displayed to the user.

Error Handling: If the input is not a valid number, an error message is shown.

**Technologies Used**
Python: The main programming language used for writing the code.

random module: Used to generate random choices for password characters.

string module: Provides access to pre-defined sets of characters like letters, digits, and punctuation symbols.

Control flow: Conditional statements (if) and try-except blocks handle input validation and error checking.

**Key Insights**
Password Requirements: The password must be at least 4 characters long for security and include at least one lowercase, uppercase, digit, and special character.

Randomization: The password is built using a combination of randomly chosen characters from ASCII letters, digits, and punctuation.

User Input: The user is prompted to provide the password length, and the program ensures it is a valid number.

Error Handling: The program checks for invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric entries) and provides feedback if an error occurs.
